Package for code structure generation

# Features

âœ… done

# Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.


# Usage

To use this plugin,
- add `clean_code` as a dev dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  clean_code: ^1.0.0 #latest version
```
- run `flutter pub get`
- for the list of available commands run this command in the terminal at the root of your project
```
flutter pub run clean_code -h
pub run clean_code -h
```

## Settings
To configure the behavior of the clean_code tool, add `clean_code.yaml` file to the root project folder.  **NOTE** that this is recommended to generate code to suit the *clean architecture* flavor and the packages you use for example **dependency injection settings**.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://github.com/lordvidex/clean_code/clean_code_schema.json

# THE COMMENT ABOVE IS REQUIRED FOR VALIDATION

clean_code:
  repositories: 
    enabled: true
    path: lib/domain/repositories
    create_implementation: false
    implementation_path: lib/data/repositories
  
  entities:
    enabled: true 
    path: lib/domain/entities

  usecases:
    enabled: false
    path: lib/domain/usecases

  models:
    enabled: true
    path: lib/domain/models

  di: 
    enabled: true
    path: lib/injection_container.dart
```

\* this file can be automatically generated by running
`flutter pub run clean_code:generate_yaml`
